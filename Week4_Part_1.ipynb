    "The objective of this project is to find a suitable region to set up a restaurant in Mumbai, India. By acquiring the grographical data online, and using Foursquare API, we can find information regarding existing venues around each neighborhood in Mumbai. These venues shall later be filtered categorically for restaurants, and clustered using K-Means Clustering. Ultimately the aim is to obtain a visual representation of the restaurant distribution in Mumbai. This would help us identify areas with relatively sparse presence of restaurants, which would indicate potential spaces to set up a restaurant of our own."
